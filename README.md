# rust_gpu_programing
trying to see if I can use rust on gpu.

## comparing to cuda

I have ran into both c style memory bugs on gpu and a lot of borrow checker bugs.
honestly borrow checker that works only on cpu memory is kind of anoying
I have been much happier with the error messages from the compiler tho. 

still to actually get a simple run going took a few hours where in cuda its trivial.
there is just a lot of setup here
